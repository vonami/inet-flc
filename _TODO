- add IdealRadio, DistanceBasedRadio, GilbertElliotRadio.
   in DistanceBasedRadio: decouple transmission range from interference range 
   (ie use 2 different module parameters)
--------
- model link failures, via isDown() method of InterfaceEntry. L2 modules 
  should understand isDown(), and FailureManager should be enhanced with
  linkdown/linkup commands. See email on list archive on 9/17/2006 10:34 AM
--------
- create NetworkInterfaces/Base subdirectory: AirFrame, WirelessMacBase,
  ChannelAccess, etc.
--------
- Ieee80211Mac to fire TxNotifDetails when Ack arrives for a frame. Mgmt layer 
  to use this notification to learn when ProbeRequest or AssociationResponse
  has been transmitted.
--------
- code consistency: use omit-get-verb everywhere, including the Ieee80211 models?
--------
- ChannelControl: grid; instead of having pMax parameter, it should ask all
  radios and collect pMax from them! (or, directly the range!)
--------
- radio models: when calculating the probability of bit errors, snirMIN is 
  assumed for the whole duration of the frame! This means that if snir 
  changes along the packet duration, we overestimate the probability of 
  bit error. (there should be proper integration there)
--------
- IReceptionModel: 
  - improve it to be able to accomodate antenna gain: calculation function
    should take node positions, antenna directions (maybe this should be in
    some IDirectionalReceptionmodel, plugging into some AbstractDirectionalRadio?)
  - allow for implementing "good/bad channel"-type radio models (Gilbert-Elliot)
    e.g. containsBadChannelState(starttime, endtime)
  - allow the radio model to add extra noise over time, or modify received power
    over time, e.g. using functions like 
      PowerList calculateReceivedPower(...)
      PowerList ambientNoise(...)
    (maybe this should be some IDetailedReceptionModel, plugging into
    a specialized version of AbstractRadio?)
--------
- AbstractRadio: consider: don't sent up the packet if there're bit errors,
  just fire some specific radio state change notification! would simplify the
  Ieee80211Mac state machine a lot! 
--------
- tummiepiggy's TCP bug ("TCP_S_FIN_WAIT_1 timeout" on mailing list)
--------
- quagga/socketmsg: use base/bytearraymessage instead
--------
- implement ICMP rate limiting, see e.g bsd.mod/netinet/ip_icmp.c, badport_bandlim()
- ICMP options: stopOnError (bool param), UDPBadPortSendICMP (bool param)
--------
- problem with NetworkConfigurator + RSVP's FailureManager: after deleting/recreating
  LSR, configured IP addresses and host routes to PPP peers get lost.
  Solution: implement failure/recovery with NF_FAILURE and NF_RECOVERY notifications!
--------
- check in Quagga documentation
- rename Daemon to QuaggaDaemon
--------
- IPvXAddress: change get4()/get6() to v4()/v6()
- Wrap RoutingEntry members into getter/setter methods!
--------
- "ack" in LinkStateMsg redundant? (never read)
Q: what is the TELinkInfo.state flag?
Q: what is UnResvBandwidth[8] indexed with? what is [4] and [7] that gets printed?

--------
- MPLS examples: there's heaps of ICMP errors coming from UDP ("port unreachable")
