INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The INET Framework can be compiled on any platform supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 3.1 or later.
It must be compiled with dynamic NED loading enabled (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes
setting).

LINUX (UNIX)

1. Make sure you OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (to test, try the command "which nedtool").

2. Change to the INET directory and edit the inetconfig file
   to make sure it contains the right settings. You'll probably
   need to adjust ROOT.

3. Type "./makemake" to create the makefiles and the omnetppconfig file.

4. Type "make" to build everything.

5. Add INET/bin directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

6. If you modify INET and add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify
   "makemakefiles", and go to step 4.

That should be it.

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change into Examples/ and type
"./rundemo".

Note:
-----
If you add/remove files later, recreate the makefiles with "./makemake".
If you add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify "makemakefiles".



WINDOWS

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW, see instructions for Unix. The instructions
below are for Visual C++ 7.1.

IMPORTANT: YOU NEED VC 7.1 .NET! INET won't compile with VC 6.0.

1. You need a working OMNeT++ installation. Make sure the sample simulations
   work OK. Also, OMNeT++ and MSVC should be in the PATH (you can verify this
   by typing "nedtool" and "nmake" at the cmd prompt.)

2. Change to the INET framework directory. Edit the inetconfig.vc file and
   adjust the OMNETPP_ROOT setting to suit your installation.

3. Run "makemake.cmd" to create the makefiles.

4. Run "nmake -f makefile.vc depend" to add dependencies to makefiles. You need 
   to do this every time you re-generate the makefiles with "makemake.bat".

5. Type "nmake -f Makefile.vc" to build everything.
      HINT: Create an "m.bat" file with the content "nmake -f Makefile.vc %*".
      It will save you a lot of typing!

6. If you modify INET and add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify
   "makemakefiles", and go to step 3.

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change to Examples/ and type
"rundemo.bat".
