<h2> LDP Message Processing</h2>
<p>The simulation follows message processing rules specified in RFC3036
(<a href="LDP-id233136.html">LDP</a> Specification). A summary of the algorithm used in the RFC is
presented below.</p>

<p><b>Label Request Message processing</b></p>

<p>An LSR may transmit a Request message under any of the conditions below:</p>

  <ul><li>The LSR recognizes a new FEC via the forwarding tale, and the next hop
  is its <a href="LDP-id233136.html">LDP</a> peer. The LIB of this LSR does not have a mapping from the
  next hop for the given FEC.</li>

  <li>Network topology changes, the next hop to the FEC is no longer valid
  and new mapping is not available.</li>

  <li>The LSR receives a Label Request for a FEC from an upstream <a href="LDP-id233136.html">LDP</a> and it
  does not have label binding information for this FEC. The FEC next hop
  is an <a href="LDP-id233136.html">LDP</a> peer.</li></ul>

<p>Upon receiving a Label Request message, the following procedures will be
performed:</p>

<p><pre>
Step 1: Extract the FEC from the message and locate the incoming interface
        of the message.
Step 2: Check whether the FEC is an outstanding FEC.
    Alternative 1: This FEC is outstanding
        Step 1: Return
    Alternative 2: This FEC is not outstanding
        Step 1: Continue
Step 3: Check if there is an exact match of the FEC in the routing table.
    Alternative 1: There is an exact match
        Step 1: Continue
    Alternative 2: There is no match
        Step 1: Construct a Notification message of No route and
                send this message back to the sender.
Step 4: Make query to local LIB to find out the corresponding label.
    Alternative 1: The label found
        Step 1: Construct a Label Mapping message and send over
                the incoming interface.
    Alternative 2: The label cannot be found for this FEC
        Step 1: Construct a new Label Request message and send
                the message out using L3 routing.
        Step 2: Construct a Notification message indicating that the
                label cannot be found.
</pre></p>

<p><b>Label Mapping Message processing</b></p>

<p>Upon receiving a Label Mapping message, the following procedures will be
performed:</p>

<p><pre>
Step 1: Extract the FEC and the label from the message.
Step 2: Check whether this is an outstanding FEC
    Alternative 1: This FEC is outstanding
        Step 1: Continue
    Alternative 2: This FEC is not outstanding
        Step 1: Send back the server an Notification of Error message.
Step 3: Install the new label to the local LIB using the extracted label,
        FEC and the message incoming interface.
