<span class="src-comment">// Prototype for radio modules. Radio modules deal with the transmission</span>

<span class="src-comment">// &lt;b&gt;Transmission&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Upper layers (wireless L2 protocols) can send frames to the radio</span>
<span class="src-comment">// module. Frames will be encapsulated into AirFrame messages and</span>
<span class="src-comment">// distributed to other network nodes within interference distance.</span>
<span class="src-comment">// The AirFrame represents the signal in the radio channel, and</span>
<span class="src-comment">// its fields hold properties of the transmission like the transmit power.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// The global ChannelControl module keeps track of node positions,</span>
<span class="src-comment">// and knows which nodes are within interference distance of others</span>
<span class="src-comment">// (neighbour list). When transmitting, the radio module obtains the</span>
<span class="src-comment">// neighbour list, and sends a copy of the AirFrame to each neighbour.</span>

<span class="src-comment">// &lt;b&gt;Reception&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Received AirFrame messages get delivered to the radioIn gate of the</span>
<span class="src-comment">// module. If it was found to have been received correctly, it gets</span>
<span class="src-comment">// decapsulated and the frame sent to the upper layer.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Note: currently the packet is also sent up if it was NOT received</span>
<span class="src-comment">// incorrectly, with its message kind set to COLLISION or BITERROR.</span>
<span class="src-comment">// This may change in the future, as erroneous receptions could also</span>
<span class="src-comment">// be signalled via the NotificationBoard.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Determining whether the frame was received correctly is a complicated</span>
<span class="src-comment">// process. The AbstractRadio C++ class from which the Ieee80211Radio</span>
<span class="src-comment">// and GenericRadio are derived, basically first calculates the received</span>
<span class="src-comment">// power of the frame, taking a path loss model into account.</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Then it calculates the signal-noise ratio, thermal noise and other</span>
<span class="src-comment">// frames being counted as noise. It is determined from the SNR</span>
<span class="src-comment">// whether the packet was received correctly, taking modulation</span>
<span class="src-comment">// scheme and possible forward error correction into account.</span>
