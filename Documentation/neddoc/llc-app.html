<h2> Ethernet: Communication between LLC and Higher Layers</h2>
<p>Higher layers (applications or protocols) talk to the <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a> module.</p>

<p>When a higher layer wants to send a packet via Ethernet, it just
passes the data packet (a cMessage or any subclass) to <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a>.
The message kind has to be set to IEEE802CTRL_DATA.</p>

<p>In general, if <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a> receives a packet from the higher layers,
it interprets the message kind as a command. The commands include
IEEE802CTRL_DATA (send a frame), IEEE802CTRL_REGISTER_DSAP (register highher layer)
IEEE802CTRL_DEREGISTER_DSAP (deregister higher layer) and IEEE802CTRL_SENDPAUSE
(send PAUSE frame) -- see <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a> for a more complete list.</p>

<p>The arguments to the command are NOT inside the data packet but
in a "control info" data structure of class <a href="Ieee802Ctrl-id239221.html">Ieee802Ctrl</a>, attached to
the packet. See controlInfo() method of cMessage (OMNeT++ 3.0).</p>

<p>For example, to send a packet to a given MAC address and protocol
identifier, the application sets the data packet's message kind
to ETH_DATA ("please send this data packet" command),
fills in the <a href="Ieee802Ctrl-id239221.html">Ieee802Ctrl</a> structure with the destination MAC address and
the protocol identifier, adds the control info to the message, then sends
the packet to <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a>.</p>

<p>When the command doesn't involve a data packet (e.g.
IEEE802CTRL_(DE)REGISTER_DSAP, IEEE802CTRL_SENDPAUSE), a dummy packet
(empty cMessage) is used.</p>

<p><h3>Rationale</h3></p>

<p>The alternative of the above communications would be:</p>

  <ul><li>adding the parameters such as destination address into the data
  packet. This would be a poor solution since it would make the
  higher layers specific to the Ethernet model.</li>

  <li>encapsulating a data packet into an <i>interface packet</i> which
  contains the destination address and other parameters. The
  disadvantages of this approach is the overhead associated with
  creating and destroying the interface packets.</li></ul>

<p>Using a control structure is more efficient than the interface packet
approach, because the control structure can be created once inside
the higher layer and be reused for every packet.</p>

<p>It may also appear to be more intuitive in Tkenv because one can observe
data packets travelling between the higher layer and Ethernet
modules -- as opposed to "interface" packets.</p>
