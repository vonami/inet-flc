<h2> Architecture of the INET Framework</h2>
<p>The INET Framework builds upon OMNeT++, and uses the same concept:
modules communicating by message passing.</p>

<p><h3>Modules and protocols</h3></p>

<p>Protocols are represented by simple modules. A simple module's external
interface (gates [connectors] and parameters) is described in a NED file,
and the implementation is contained in a C++ class with the same name.
Some examples: <a href="TCP-id271256.html">TCP</a>, <a href="IP-id231134.html">IP</a>.</p>

<p>These modules can be freely combined to form hosts and other network devices
with the NED language (no C++ code and no recompilation required).
Various pre-assembled host, router, switch, access point, etc. models can
be found in the <code>Nodes/</code> subdirectory (for example: <a href="StandardHost-id259540.html">StandardHost</a>,
<a href="Router-id259068.html">Router</a>), but you can also create your own ones for tailored to your particular
simulation scenarios.</p>

<p>Network interfaces (Ethernet, 802.11, etc) are usually compound modules (i.e.
assembled from simple modules) themselves, and are being composed of a queue,
a MAC, and possibly other simple modules. See <a href="EthernetInterface-id241239.html">EthernetInterface</a> as an example.</p>

<p>Not all modules implement protocols though. There are modules which hold
data (for example <a href="RoutingTable-id231049.html">RoutingTable</a>), facilitate communication of modules
(<a href="NotificationBoard-id225662.html">NotificationBoard</a>), perform autoconfiguration of a network
(<a href="FlatNetworkConfigurator-id227631.html">FlatNetworkConfigurator</a>), move a mobile node around (for example
<a href="ConstSpeedMobility-id226290.html">ConstSpeedMobility</a>), and perform housekeeping associated with radio channels
in wireless simulations (<a href="ChannelControl-id272488.html">ChannelControl</a>).</p>

<p>Protocol headers and packet formats are described in message definition
files (msg files), which are translated into C++ classes by OMNeT++'s
<i>opp_msgc</i> tool. The generated message classes subclass from OMNeT++'s
<code>cMessage</code> class.</p>

<p><h3>About the documentation</h3></p>

<p>The INET Framework documentation itself is also comprised of two bodies of HTML pages:
<i>neddoc</i> generated from NED and MSG files using OMNeT++'s <i>opp_neddoc</i> tool,
and the documentation of the underlying C++ classes, generated from the source files
using Doxygen.
The C++ doc is generated in a way that it contains <b>the full C++ source code</b>
as HTML pages. It is syntax highlighted, and variable and class names are hyperlinked
and cross-referenced, which makes it convenient for exploring the code.</p>

<p><h3>Common modules in hosts and routers</h3></p>

<p>There are some common modules that appear in all (or many) host, router and device
models.</p>

  <ul><li><a href="InterfaceTable-id227840.html">InterfaceTable</a>. This module contains the table of network interfaces
  (eth0, wlan0, etc) in the host. This module does not send or receive messages:
  it is accessed by other modules using standard C++ member function calls.
  Other modules rely on the interface table submodule within the host to be called
  <code>interfaceTable</code> to be able to find it. (They obtain a <code>cModule *</code>
  pointer to it, then cast it to <code>InterfaceTable *</code> to be able to call its
  functions). Network interfaces get dynamically registered (added to the table)
  by simple modules implementing the network interface, for example <a href="EtherMAC-id240352.html">EtherMAC</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="RoutingTable-id231049.html">RoutingTable</a>. This module contains the IP (v4) routing table, and heavily relies
  on <a href="InterfaceTable-id227840.html">InterfaceTable</a> for its operation. This module is also accessed from other
  modules (typically <a href="IP-id231134.html">IP</a>) by calling the public member functions of its C++ class.
  There are member functions for querying, adding, deleting routes, and
  finding the best matching route for a given destination IP address.
  The routing table submodule within the host (router) must be called
  <code>routingTable</code> for other modules to find it.</li>

  <li><a href="RoutingTable6-id232346.html">RoutingTable6</a>. This is like <a href="RoutingTable-id231049.html">RoutingTable</a>, but for <a href="IPv6-id232445.html">IPv6</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="NotificationBoard-id225662.html">NotificationBoard</a>. This module makes it possible for several modules to
  communicate in a publish-subscribe manner. For example, the radio module
  (<a href="Ieee80211Radio-id254399.html">Ieee80211Radio</a>) fires a <i>"radio state changed"</i> notification when
  the state of the radio channel changes (from TRANSMIT to IDLE, for example),
  and it will be delivered to other modules that have previously subscribed
  to that notification category. The notification mechanism also works
  my C++ functions calls, no message sending is involved.
  The notification board submodule within the host (router) must be called
  <code>notificationBoard</code> for other modules to find it.</li></ul>

<p><h3>Common modules at network level</h3></p>

<p>Some modules have only one instance, at global network level:</p>

  <ul><li><a href="FlatNetworkConfigurator-id227631.html">FlatNetworkConfigurator</a> assigns <a href="IP-id231134.html">IP</a> addresses to hosts and routers,
  and sets up static routing.</li>

  <li><a href="ScenarioManager-id272727.html">ScenarioManager</a> makes simulations scriptable. Modules can be made to support
  scripting by implementing the <code>IScriptable</code> C++ interface.</li>

  <li><a href="ChannelControl-id272488.html">ChannelControl</a> is required for wireless simulations. It keeps track of which
  nodes are within interference distance of other nodes.</li></ul>

<p><h3>Communication between protocol layers</h3></p>

<p>In the INET Framework, when an upper-layer protocol wants to send a data
packet over a lower-layer protocol, the upper-layer module just sends the
message object representing the packet to the lower-layer module, which
will in turn encapsulate it and send it. The reverse process takes place
when a lower layer protocol receives a packet and sends it up after
decapsulation.</p>

<p>It is often necessary to convey extra information with the packet. For
example, when an application-layer module wants to send data over <a href="TCP-id271256.html">TCP</a>, some
connection identifier needs to be specified for <a href="TCP-id271256.html">TCP</a>. When <a href="TCP-id271256.html">TCP</a> sends a
segment over <a href="IP-id231134.html">IP</a>, <a href="IP-id231134.html">IP</a> will need a destination address and possibly other
parameters like TTL. When <a href="IP-id231134.html">IP</a> sends a datagram to an Ethernet interface for
transmission, a destination MAC address must be specified. This extra
information is attached to the message object to as <i>control info</i>.</p>

<p>Control info are small value objects, which are attached to packets
(message objects) with its <code>setControlInfo()</code> member function.
Control info only holds auxiliary information for the next protocol layer,
and is not supposed to be sent over the network to other hosts and routers.</p>
