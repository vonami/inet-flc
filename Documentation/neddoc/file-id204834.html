<span class="src-comment">// Wehrle, Jochen Reber, Dirk Holzhausen, Volker Boehm, Verena Kahmann,</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Ulrich Kaage and others at the University of Karlsruhe during 2000-2001,</span>
<span class="src-comment">// under the name IPSuite.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// The \MPLS, \LDP and \RSVP-TE models were built as an add-on to IPSuite</span>
<span class="src-comment">// during 2003 by Xuan Thang Nguyen (Xuan.T.Nguyen@uts.edu.au) and other</span>
<span class="src-comment">// students at the University of Technology, Sydney under supervision of</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Dr Robin Brown. The package consisted of around 10,000 LOCs, and was</span>
<span class="src-comment">// published at http://charlie.it.uts.edu.au/~tkaphan/xtn/capstone (now</span>
<span class="src-comment">// unavailable).</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// After a period of IPSuite being unmaintained, Andras Varga took over</span>
<span class="src-comment">// the development in July 2003. Through a series of snapshot releases in</span>
<span class="src-comment">// 2003-2004, modules got completely reorganized, documented, and many of them</span>
<span class="src-comment">// rewritten from scratch. The \MPLS models (including \RSVP-TE, \LDP, etc)</span>
<span class="src-comment">// also got refactored and merged into the codebase. The complete change log</span>

<span class="src-comment">// During 2004, Andras added a new, modular and extensible \TCP implementation,</span>
<span class="src-comment">// application models, Ethernet implementation and an all-in-one \IP model</span>
<span class="src-comment">// to replace the earlier, modularized one.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// The package was renamed INET Framework in October 2004.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Support for wireless and mobile networks got added during summer 2005</span>

<span class="src-comment">// The \MPLS models (including \LDP and \RSVP-TE) got revised and mostly</span>

<span class="src-comment">// The OSPFv2 model was created by Andras Babos during 2004 for his diploma</span>
<span class="src-comment">// thesis which was submitted early 2005. After several refinements and fixes,</span>
<span class="src-comment">// the code got merged into the INET Framework in 2005, and became part of the</span>
<span class="src-comment">// March 2006 INET snapshot.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// The Quagga routing daemon was ported into the INET Framework also by Vojta</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Janota. During fall 2005 and the months after, ripd and ospfd got ported,</span>
<span class="src-comment">// and the methodology of porting got refined. It is planned to port further</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Quagga daemons after March 2006.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// Based on experience from the IPv6Suite (from Ahmet Sekercioglu's group at</span>
<span class="src-comment">// CTIE, Monash University, Melbourne) and IPv6SuiteWithINET (Andras's effort</span>
<span class="src-comment">// to refactor IPv6Suite and merge it with INET early 2005), Wei Yang Ng</span>
<span class="src-comment">// (Monash Uni) implemented a new \IPv6 model from scratch for the</span>
<span class="src-comment">// INET Framework in 2005 for his diploma thesis, under guidance from Andras</span>
<span class="src-comment">// who was visiting Monash between February and June 2005. This \IPv6 model</span>
<span class="src-comment">// got first included in the July 2005 INET snapshot, and gradually refined</span>
