<h2> EtherLLC: SAP Registration</h2>
<p>The Ethernet model supports multiple applications or higher layer
protocols.</p>

<p>So that data arriving from the network can be dispatched to the
correct applications (higher layer protocols), applications
have to register themselves in <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a>. The registration
is done with the IEEE802CTRL_REGISTER_DSAP command
(see <a href="llc-app.html">communication between LLC and higher layers</a>)
which associates a SAP with the LLC port. Different applications
have to connect to different ports of <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a>.</p>

<p>The ETHERCTRL_REGISTER_DSAP/IEEE802CTRL_DEREGISTER_DSAP commands use only the
dsap field in the <a href="Ieee802Ctrl-id239221.html">Ieee802Ctrl</a> structure.</p>
