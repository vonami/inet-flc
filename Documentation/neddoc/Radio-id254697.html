<h2 class="comptitle">Simple Module <i>Radio</i>
</h2>
<p><b>File: <a href="file-id254624.html">NetworkInterfaces/Radio/Radio.ned</a></b></p>
<p>Prototype for radio modules. <a href="Radio-id254697.html">Radio</a> modules deal with the transmission
of frames over a wireless medium (the radio channel).</p>

<p><b>Transmission</b></p>

<p>Upper layers (wireless L2 protocols) can send frames to the radio
module. Frames will be encapsulated into <a href="AirFrame-id252991.html">AirFrame</a> messages and
distributed to other network nodes within interference distance.
The <a href="AirFrame-id252991.html">AirFrame</a> represents the signal in the radio channel, and
its fields hold properties of the transmission like the transmit power.</p>

<p>The global <a href="ChannelControl-id272488.html">ChannelControl</a> module keeps track of node positions,
and knows which nodes are within interference distance of others
(neighbour list). When transmitting, the radio module obtains the
neighbour list, and sends a copy of the <a href="AirFrame-id252991.html">AirFrame</a> to each neighbour.</p>

<p><b>Reception</b></p>

<p>Received <a href="AirFrame-id252991.html">AirFrame</a> messages get delivered to the radioIn gate of the
module. If it was found to have been received correctly, it gets
decapsulated and the frame sent to the upper layer.</p>

<p>Note: currently the packet is also sent up if it was NOT received
incorrectly, with its message kind set to COLLISION or BITERROR.
This may change in the future, as erroneous receptions could also
be signalled via the <a href="NotificationBoard-id225662.html">NotificationBoard</a>.</p>

<p>Determining whether the frame was received correctly is a complicated
process. The AbstractRadio C++ class from which the <a href="Ieee80211Radio-id254399.html">Ieee80211Radio</a>
and <a href="GenericRadio-id254136.html">GenericRadio</a> are derived, basically first calculates the received
power of the frame, taking a path loss model into account.
Then it calculates the signal-noise ratio, thermal noise and other
frames being counted as noise. It is determined from the SNR
whether the packet was received correctly, taking modulation
scheme and possible forward error correction into account.
For details please see the C++ code and its documentation.</p>

<p><b>Monitoring the radio state</b></p>

<p>Wireless L2 protocols and other modules within the node can monitor
radio transmissions and receptions by subscribing to the
<code>NF_RADIOSTATE_CHANGED</code> category at the <a href="NotificationBoard-id225662.html">NotificationBoard</a>
module of the node.</p>

<p><b>Dynamically configuring the radio</b></p>

<p>The bitrate and the receive/transmit channel can be changed by sending
<a href="Radio-id254697.html">Radio</a> a blank cMessage with <tt>PHY_C_CONFIGURERADIO</tt> as message kind, and
a <a href="PhyControlInfo-id239333.html">PhyControlInfo</a> object attached to it as control info, to hold the
new bitrate and/or channel number. If the radio is currently transmitting,
the change will actually take place after the transmission is completed.</p>

<p>It is also possible to specify a different bitrate for individual frames;
to do that, attach a <a href="PhyControlInfo-id239333.html">PhyControlInfo</a> with bitrate filled in to the frame.</p>
