<span class="src-comment">// Notes:</span>
<span class="src-comment">//  - if you do active OPEN, then send data and close before the connection</span>
<span class="src-comment">//    has reached ESTABLISHED, the connection will go from SYN_SENT to CLOSED</span>
<span class="src-comment">//    without actually sending the buffered data. This is consistent with </span>
