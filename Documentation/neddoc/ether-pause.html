<h2> Ethernet: PAUSE handling</h2>
<p>The 802.3x standard supports PAUSE frames as a means of flow
control. The frame contains a timer value, expressed as a multiple
of 512 bit-times, that specifies how long the transmitter should
remain quiet. If the receiver becomes uncongested before the
transmitter's pause timer expires, the receiver may elect to send
another Pause frame to the transmitter with a timer value of zero,
allowing the transmitter to resume immediately.</p>

<p><a href="EtherMAC-id240352.html">EtherMAC</a> will properly respond to PAUSE frames it receives
(<a href="EtherPauseFrame-id242543.html">EtherPauseFrame</a> class, ETH_PAUSE message kind),
however it will never send a PAUSE frame by itself. (For one thing,
it doesn't have an input buffer that can overflow.)</p>

<p><a href="EtherMAC-id240352.html">EtherMAC</a>, however, transmits PAUSE frames received by higher layers,
and <a href="EtherLLC-id240022.html">EtherLLC</a> can be instructed by a command to send a PAUSE frame to MAC.</p>

<p><a href="MACRelayUnit-id243370.html">MACRelayUnit</a> types (and thus <a href="EtherSwitch-id242754.html">EtherSwitch</a>) currently implement a very simple
scheme for sending PAUSE frames -- this can be refined if the need arises.</p>
