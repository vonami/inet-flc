<h2> LIB Table File Format</h2>
<p>The format of a LIB table file is:</p>

<p>The beginning of the file should begin with comments. Lines begin with # are treated
as comments. An empty line is required after the comments. The "LIB TABLE"
syntax must come next with an empty line. The column headers follow. This header
must be strictly "In-lbl In-intf Out-lbl Out-intf". Column
values are after that with space or tab for field separation.
The following is a sample of lib table file.</p>

<p><pre>
#lib table for <a href="MPLS-id233905.html">MPLS</a> network simulation test
#lib1.table for LSR1 - this is an edge router
#no incoming label for traffic from in-intf 0 &amp; 1 - LSR1 is ingress router for those traffic
#no outgoing label for traffic from in_intf 2 &amp; 3 - LSR 1 is egress router for those traffic

LIB TABLE:

In-lbl  In-intf         Out-lbl     Out-intf
1       193.233.7.90    1           193.231.7.21
2       193.243.2.1     0           193.243.2.3
