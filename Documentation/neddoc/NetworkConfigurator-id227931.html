<h2 class="comptitle">Simple Module <i>NetworkConfigurator</i>
</h2>
<p><b>File: <a href="file-id227869.html">Network/AutoRouting/NetworkConfigurator.ned</a></b></p>
<p><b>C++ definition: <a href="../doxy/class_network_configurator.html" target="_top">click here</a></b></p>
<p>Configures IP addresses and routing tables for a network.</p>

<p>This module does't connect to any other modules (it has no gates),
and should have only one instance in the whole model. The module
will only run once, at the beginning of the simulation.
When it runs, it will:</p>

  <ol><li>assign IP addresses to hosts and routers.</li>

  <li>then it'll discover the topology of the network (using OMNeT++'s
      cTopology class), and calculate shortest paths;</li>

  <li>finally, it will add routes which correspond to the shortest
      paths to the routing tables (see <a href="RoutingTable-id231049.html">RoutingTable</a>::addRoutingEntry()).</li></ol>

<p>How does it know which modules are routers, hosts, et.c that need to
be configured, and what is the network topology? The configurator
picks all modules of types listed in the moduleTypes parameter and
their connections, and builds a graph from it. Then it runs Dijstra's
shortest path algorithm on it.</p>

<p>To avoid interference with the above algorithm, it's recommended that
no host or router should have its address set explicitly, and
no routes are set up manually. Practically, routing files (.irt, .mrt)
should be missing or empty.</p>

<p>All the above takes place in initialization stage 2. (In stage 0,
interfaces register themselves in the <a href="InterfaceTable-id227840.html">InterfaceTable</a> modules, and
in stage 1, routing files are read.)</p>
