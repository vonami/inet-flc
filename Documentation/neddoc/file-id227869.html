<span class="src-comment">// This module does't connect to any other modules (it has no gates),</span>
<span class="src-comment">// and should have only one instance in the whole model. The module</span>
<span class="src-comment">// will only run once, at the beginning of the simulation.</span>
<span class="src-comment">// When it runs, it will:</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">//   -#  assign \IP addresses to hosts and routers.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//   -#  then it'll discover the topology of the network (using OMNeT++'s</span>
<span class="src-comment">//       cTopology class), and calculate shortest paths;</span>
<span class="src-comment">//   -#  finally, it will add routes which correspond to the shortest</span>

<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// How does it know which modules are routers, hosts, et.c that need to</span>
<span class="src-comment">// be configured, and what is the network topology? The configurator</span>
<span class="src-comment">// picks all modules of types listed in the moduleTypes parameter and</span>
<span class="src-comment">// their connections, and builds a graph from it. Then it runs Dijstra's</span>
<span class="src-comment">// shortest path algorithm on it.</span>
<span class="src-comment">//</span>
<span class="src-comment">// To avoid interference with the above algorithm, it's recommended that</span>
<span class="src-comment">// no host or router should have its address set explicitly, and</span>
<span class="src-comment">// no routes are set up manually. Practically, routing files (.irt, .mrt)</span>
<span class="src-comment">// should be missing or empty.</span>

<span class="src-comment">// All the above takes place in initialization stage 2. (In stage 0,</span>
